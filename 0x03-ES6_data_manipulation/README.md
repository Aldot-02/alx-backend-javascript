## TASKS FOR THIS PROJECT
### 0. Basic list of objects

Create a function named `getListStudents` that returns an array of objects.

Each object should have three attributes: `id` (Number), `firstName` (String), and `location` (String).

The array contains the following students in order:

* `Guillaume`, id: `1`, in `San Francisco`
* `James`, id: `2`, in `Columbia`
* `Serena`, id: `5`, in `San Francisco`

### 1. More mapping

Create a function `getListStudentIds` that returns an array of ids from a list of object.

This function is taking one argument which is an array of objects - and this array is the same format as getListStudents from the previous task.

If the argument is not an array, the function is returning an empty array.

You must use the `map` function on the array.


### 2. Filter

Create a function `getStudentsByLocation` that returns an array of objects who are located in a specific city.

It should accept a list of students (from `getListStudents`) and a `city` (string) as parameters.

You must use the `filter` function on the array.


### 3. Reduce

Create a function `getStudentIdsSum` that returns the sum of all the student ids.

It should accept a list of students (from `getListStudents`) as a parameter.

You must use the `reduce` function on the array.


### 4. Combine

Create a function `updateStudentGradeByCity` that returns an array of students for a specific city with their new grade

It should accept a list of students (from `getListStudents`), a `city` (String), and `newGrades` (Array of “grade” objects) as parameters.

`newGrades` is an array of objects with this format:
```
  {
    studentId: 31,
    grade: 78,
  }
```

If a student doesn’t have grade in `newGrades`, the final grade should be `N/A`.

You must use `filter` and `map` combined.

```main.js
[
  {
    id: 1,
    firstName: 'Guillaume',
    location: 'San Francisco',
    grade: 86
  },
  { id: 5, firstName: 'Serena', location: 'San Francisco', grade: 97 }
]
[
  {
    id: 1,
    firstName: 'Guillaume',
    location: 'San Francisco',
    grade: 'N/A'
  },
  { id: 5, firstName: 'Serena', location: 'San Francisco', grade: 97 }
]
```

### 5. Typed Arrays

Create a function named `createInt8TypedArray` that returns a new `ArrayBuffer` with an `Int8` value at a specific position.

It should accept three arguments: `length` (Number), `position` (Number), and `value` (Number).

If adding the value is not possible the error `Position outside range` should be thrown.

```main.js
DataView {
  byteLength: 10,
  byteOffset: 0,
  buffer: ArrayBuffer {
    [Uint8Contents]: <00 00 59 00 00 00 00 00 00 00>,
    byteLength: 10
  }
}
```

### 6. Set data structure

Create a function named `setFromArray` that returns a `Set` from an array.

It accepts an argument (Array, of any kind of element).


### 7. More set data structure

Create a function named `hasValuesFromArray` that returns a boolean if all the elements in the array exist within the set.

It accepts two arguments: a `set` (Set) and an `array` (Array).


### 8. Clean set

Create a function named `cleanSet` that returns a string of all the set values that start with a specific string (`startString`).

It accepts two arguments: a `set` (Set) and a `startString` (String).

When a value starts with `startString` you only append the rest of the string. The string contains all the values of the set separated by `-`.


### 9. Map data structure

Create a function named `groceriesList` that returns a map of groceries with the following items (name, quantity):

```
Apples, 10
Tomatoes, 10
Pasta, 1
Rice, 1
Banana, 5
```
Result:
```
bob@dylan:~$ cat 9-main.js
import groceriesList from "./9-groceries_list.js";

console.log(groceriesList());

bob@dylan:~$ 
bob@dylan:~$ npm run dev 9-main.js 
Map {
  'Apples' => 10,
  'Tomatoes' => 10,
  'Pasta' => 1,
  'Rice' => 1,
  'Banana' => 5
}
bob@dylan:~$ 
```

### 10. More map data structure

Create a function named `updateUniqueItems` that returns an updated map for all items with initial quantity at 1.

It should accept a map as an argument. The map it accepts for argument is similar to the map you create in the previous task.

For each entry of the map where the quantity is 1, update the quantity to 100. If updating the quantity is not possible (argument is not a map) the error `Cannot process` should be thrown.

### 11. Weak Link data structure

Export a `const` instance of `WeakMap` and name it `weakMap`.

Export a new function named `queryAPI`. It should accept an endpoint argument like so:

```
{
    protocol: 'http',
    name: 'getUsers',
}
```

Track within the `weakMap` the number of times `queryAPI` is called for each endpoint.

When the number of queries is >= 5 throw an error with the message `Endpoint load is high`.


```
bob@dylan:~$ cat 100-main.js
import { queryAPI, weakMap } from "./100-weak.js";

const endpoint = { protocol: 'http', name: 'getUsers' };
weakMap.get(endpoint);

queryAPI(endpoint);
console.log(weakMap.get(endpoint));

queryAPI(endpoint);
console.log(weakMap.get(endpoint));

queryAPI(endpoint);
queryAPI(endpoint);
queryAPI(endpoint);
queryAPI(endpoint);

bob@dylan:~$ 
bob@dylan:~$ npm run dev 100-main.js 
1
2
.../100-weak.js:16
    throw new Error('Endpoint load is high');
   ...
bob@dylan:~$
```
